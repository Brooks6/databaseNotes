1.Database Management System(DBMS)
A special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
*make it easy to manage large amounts of information
*handles security
*backups
*importing/exporting data
*concurrency //?
*interacts with software applications

2.C.R.U.D(create, read, update, delete)

3.relational databases(SQL)
Organize data into one or more tables
*each table has columns and rows
*a unique key identifies each row

4.non-relational(noSQL/ not just SQL)
Organize data is anything but a traditional table
*key-value stores
*documents(JSON, XML, etc)
*graphs
*flexible table

5.relational database management system(RDBMS)
Help users create and maintain a relational database
*mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc

6.structured query language(SQL)
*standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
*Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administrative tasks(user management, security, backup, etc)
*used to define tables and structures
*SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

7.non-relational database management systems(NRDBMS)
Non-relational database management system(NRDBMS)
Help users create and maintain a non-relational database
*mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc

8.implementation specific
*any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set language standard
*most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing C.R.U.D and administrative operations on the database
